""" 
Explanation:
- We define a function `insert_payment` to insert payment information into the nested dictionary based on the preferred plan.
- The function iterates through the dictionary, checks the plan for each user, and assigns the corresponding payment amount.
- We then print out the payment for each user.
- In the `main` function, we take user input for the number of users and their names and preferred plans.
- We create a nested dictionary to store this information.
- Finally, we call the `insert_payment` function to calculate and print the payment for each user.
