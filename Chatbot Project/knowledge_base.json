      "question": " I\u2019m supposed to take 10 mg once daily.",

    },
    {
      "question": " I sometimes feel a bit dizzy after taking it. Is that normal?",
      "answer": "Dizziness can be a common side effect, especially when starting the medication or increasing the dose. It\u2019s usually due to the drop in blood pressure. Make sure to get up slowly from sitting or lying down to reduce the risk of dizziness. If the dizziness persists or is severe, you should contact your doctor. Are you experiencing any other side effects?"
    },
    {
      "question": "No, just the dizziness. Thanks for the advice!",
